# Login Auth with Next.js

This is a simple project aimed at improvement and nothing special. It's built using Next.js, Auth.js, and PostgreSQL with Prisma for the database.

* Some of the current todos include:
* Implement sign-up with email and password.
* Enable password reset by sending a reset link via email.
